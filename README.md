# Dashboard Bike Sales on Tableau
In this project, I analyzed a bicycle sales dataset with various features such as Year, Customer Age, Age Group, Customer Gender, Country, State, Product Category, Sub-Category, Product, Order Quantity, Unit Cost, Unit Price, Profit, Cost, and Revenue.

Business Understanding: My primary objective was to understand patterns and trends in bicycle sales to optimize marketing strategies and increase revenue. I wanted to understand the customer demographics that contributed the most to sales and identify the most popular products.

Data Understanding: In this phase, I analyzed the role and impact of each feature on overall sales. For example, Customer Age and Age Group provided insights into the age demographics of my customers.

Data Preparation: Involves cleaning and organizing the data for analysis. This may include handling missing values or outliers and data type transformation if needed.

Data Visualization: The visualization in Tableau provides a comprehensive analysis of bicycle sales. It displays the top products sold by quantity where Water Bottles - 30 oz, and by gender then road bikes lead; also shows product category sales by gender showing men buying more than women across all categories.

•	Profit and YoY % Change: In 2014, profits totaled $7,528,563 with an annual growth (YoY Change) of 28.4%.
•	Revenue: The line graph also reveals that revenue for the year reached $20,023,991. This is a positive indicator of strong business performance and steady revenue growth.
•	Top Three Products: The table of the top three products in terms of revenue is accessories with $1,588,464; bicycles with $18,060,155; and clothing with $1,375,868. This helps in identifying which items are best-sellers and generate the highest revenue for the business.

This detailed visualization helps in making informed decisions such as focusing marketing efforts on specific age groups or geographical locations or even expanding a well-performing product line to maximize profits.
