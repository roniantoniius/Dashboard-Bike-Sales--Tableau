Business Understanding: My primary objective was to understand patterns and trends in bicycle sales to optimize marketing strategies and increase revenue. I wanted to understand the customer demographics that contributed the most to sales and identify the most popular products.

Data Understanding: In this phase, I analyzed the role and impact of each feature on overall sales. For example, Customer Age and Age Group provided insights into the age demographics of my customers.

Data Preparation: Involves cleaning and organizing the data for analysis. This may include handling missing values or outliers and data type transformation if needed.

Data Visualization: The visualization in Tableau provides a comprehensive analysis of bicycle sales. It displays the top products sold by quantity where Water Bottles - 30 oz, and by gender then road bikes lead; also shows product category sales by gender showing men buying more than women across all categories.

•	Profit and YoY % Change: In 2014, profits totaled $7,528,563 with an annual growth (YoY Change) of 28.4%.
•	Revenue: The line graph also reveals that revenue for the year reached $20,023,991. This is a positive indicator of strong business performance and steady revenue growth.
•	Top Three Products: The table of the top three products in terms of revenue is accessories with $1,588,464; bicycles with $18,060,155; and clothing with $1,375,868. This helps in identifying which items are best-sellers and generate the highest revenue for the business.
